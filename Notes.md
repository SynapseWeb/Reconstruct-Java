# Reconstruct Java Notes and Log
## This document is intended to collect notes on the Java implementation and document its progress.

# Notes:

The first tests have demonstrated that Java can handle the loading, zooming, and panning of large images very well!

# Log:

**March 13th, 2018** - Began experimenting with the Java XML classes for reading existing Reconstruct XML files. It's not clear (at this time) whether the current XML representation should be used as it is or not. But in any event, it seems likely that we'll want to have the ability to open previous XML files to import. The exact format of the XML files is still being deduced.
