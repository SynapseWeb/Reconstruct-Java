This version uses the familiar menus from the earlier Reconstruct. Most of the menus are non-functional.

This version does support importing a single image with the **Series/Import/Images...** option.

This version supports switching between **Move Mode** and **Draw Mode** via the space bar. These modes are:

**Move Mode:** The image can be zoomed with the mouse scrollwheel and panned with mouse click and drag.

**Draw Mode:** The image can be zoomed with the scrollwheel. Multiple outlines can be drawn with click and drag.
